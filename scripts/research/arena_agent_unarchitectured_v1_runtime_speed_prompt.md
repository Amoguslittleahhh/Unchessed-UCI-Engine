# Engineering request: make the AegisV4Chessformer runtime forward pass fast enough to actually use

## Scope note

Unarchitectured v1 is the canonical, current architecture — the target to
build on and improve. Its predecessors (Apex v1, Hydra v1 through v4, and
any earlier lineage) were beta-testing iterations superseded by it; this
work is not an invitation to revert to or resume development on any of
them. Any follow-on architecture or training work belongs on top of
Unarchitectured v1, not as a parallel track exploring an earlier one.

## Status update — round 2

Your first pass (`c91937e`, "Accelerate Unarchitectured v1 Chessformer
runtime") was reviewed, independently re-benchmarked, and merged: real,
verified **75ms → 14.55ms per forward pass (~5.2x)** measured on the
reviewer's own machine, not just the number reported in your commit message.
Now on `main` at `464480e`.

Two things from that pass to know about:

1. **A real bug was found and fixed before merging, not just "unvalidated"
   as the commit message framed it.** The pooled board-token accumulator
   (`pooled`, used for the value head and the final representation) was
   hard-coded to the full `D_MODEL` (256) length and fed directly into
   width-sized `scaled_add`/`dot_product` calls for the narrower matryoshka
   exits (128, 192) — a genuine length mismatch that failed your own
   included `elastic_exit_shapes_and_finiteness` test on the reviewer's
   machine. Fixed by slicing `pooled[..width]` at both call sites (final
   pooling, value head). A new test, `narrow_exits_match_python_reference`,
   locks this in against real Python-reference numbers (`--all-exits` on
   `reference_forward_aegis_v4.py`) so it can't silently regress — go run it
   before building on top of this area. Its evidence/representation checks
   use an intentionally wider tolerance (2e-2 vs. the usual 5e-3) because
   those two are both derived from the same 64-term sequential pooled sum,
   whose accumulation order legitimately differs from PyTorch's internal
   reduction; logits and best-move selection — the values that actually
   decide anything — still hold to 5e-3 for both narrow exits. If you can
   tighten that gap (e.g. pairwise/tree summation instead of a linear
   sequential accumulate) that's worth doing, but it's not blocking.

2. **The narrow/shallow exits (128, 192) are now correct, not just
   fast-and-broken, but they still aren't wired into anything.** Full scope
   for actually using them (distillation-time supervision, or a real
   accuracy-vs-speed tradeoff at inference) is still open and untouched.

Where things stand against the "what's needed" section below: 14.55ms is a
huge improvement but still a long way from "cheap enough to pay once per
move" (the original SPRT failure was caused by ~89ms/move being a
devastating tax at real time controls — 14.55ms is ~6x better but likely
still too much at fast time controls; nobody has re-run the SPRT gate with
this new number, so don't assume it's safe yet). Keep pushing on speed
(int8 integer dot products at inference time specifically remain untried
and are probably the next-biggest win), and don't re-attempt the
move-ordering integration without a fresh SPRT gate — the same discipline
that caught the first attempt's catastrophic failure.

## Context

Unchessed AI is a from-scratch Rust UCI chess engine
(github.com/Amoguslittleahhh/Unchessed-UCI-Engine). Its main evaluator is a
small NNUE. Separately, a much larger transformer architecture
("Unarchitectured v1" / `AegisV4Chessformer`, 4.2M-param student distilled
from a 58M-param oracle) was trained end-to-end on real Lichess data this
session and produces a real, calibrated, quantized checkpoint (student's
architecture: 8 layers, d_model=256, 8 heads, per-layer learned geometric
attention bias from templates, LoRA-adapted policy heads, a per-legal-move
regret head, an evidential WDL value head). That whole training pipeline —
data mining, Stockfish teacher-labeling, safety-gated training, export,
strict validation — is done and not what this prompt is about.

This prompt is about the *runtime* side: a pure-Rust inference forward pass
for that architecture now exists (`unchessed-core/src/aegis_v4_runtime.rs`,
committed on `main` at `cfd33ef`), and it is **numerically correct** —
cross-checked against an independent Python reference
(`tools/reference_forward_aegis_v4.py`) run on the same real exported
checkpoint, on two different real positions, matching within 5e-3 on every
output value and picking the identical best move both times. There's also
an end-to-end test confirming the real `Position → PositionInput` converter
(real movegen, real board state, the mover-perspective vertical-flip
transform) produces correct model input, not just hand-built fixtures.

**The problem: it's far too slow to actually use.** Release-build
benchmark: **~89ms per forward pass** (`cargo test -p unchessed-core
--release benchmark_forward_pass -- --ignored --nocapture`), computed with
straightforward nested loops — no SIMD, no BLAS, no batching, nothing.

## What was tried and why it failed

The obvious "smallest, safest" integration point seemed to be: compute the
forward pass once per `go()` call, use the policy logits to set the
*initial* move-ordering at the root before any real search score exists
(doesn't touch eval, doesn't touch node-level search logic, real search
scores completely override it after the first iteration). This was wired
in, SPRT-gated per the project's normal discipline (never trust a change
without a real game-play test), and **failed catastrophically** — a 20-game
smoke test came back 0-20-0 for the version with the hint enabled, not a
subtle regression.

Root cause: `go()` is called once **per move**, for the entire game — not
once per game. At real time controls (the smoke test used `tc=5+0.05`,
matching this project's other SPRT gates), paying a fixed extra ~89ms on
*every single move* is a devastating tax relative to the ~100-250ms
per-move think times the engine normally uses at that time control —
routinely 40-60%+ of a move's entire budget spent on the forward pass
instead of search, showing up directly as consistently shallower depth and
a severe strength loss. The wiring was reverted (nothing broken landed on
`main`); only the validated, unwired `aegis_v4_runtime.rs` module was kept.

## What's needed

Either (or both) of:

1. **A large (roughly 20-90x) speedup of the forward pass itself**, so it
   becomes cheap enough to pay once per move (ideally under a few ms) or
   even eventually per-node (ideally sub-millisecond, though that's a much
   higher bar and may not be realistic for a model this size). The current
   implementation is genuinely naive — plain triple-nested loops for every
   matmul, no cache blocking, no vectorization, dequantizing to `f32` once
   at load but doing all arithmetic in scalar `f32` after that. Concrete
   angles worth investigating, roughly in order of expected effort-to-payoff:
   - SIMD (portable `std::simd` nightly, or stable via `wide`/manual AVX2
     intrinsics with a scalar fallback) for the matmul-heavy paths: the QKV
     projection, the FFN up/down projections, and the policy/regret head
     linear layers dominate the cost (8 layers × several 256×256 matmuls
     each, all on 64 board-square tokens).
   - Actually exploiting the int8 quantization at inference time (integer
     dot products) instead of dequantizing everything to f32 immediately on
     load and never touching int8 arithmetic again — this is probably the
     single biggest win available and hasn't been attempted at all yet.
   - Cache-friendlier loop ordering / blocking for the 64-token × 256-width
     attention and FFN computations.
   - Consider whether an existing pure-Rust linear-algebra crate (with no
     heavyweight dependencies, matching this project's existing
     zero-framework style — see how `unchessed-core/src/nnue.rs` and
     `policy.rs` are implemented) is worth pulling in vs. hand-rolling.

2. **A cost-amortizing integration strategy** that doesn't require the
   forward pass to be cheap on every move: e.g. compute it once at the
   start of a game/search session and reuse it as a static bias for several
   moves (accepting staleness as the position evolves), or run it
   asynchronously in a background thread that updates a shared hint without
   blocking the move clock, or restrict its use to specific slow-anyway
   situations (first move of a session, or only when there's a large clock
   surplus). Any such strategy needs its own SPRT gate before being trusted
   — the same discipline that caught the first attempt's failure — since
   "seems obviously safe" was already wrong once here.

Whichever direction: **any change to `aegis_v4_runtime.rs` must keep
passing its existing test suite** — the two Python-cross-check parity
tests (`start_position_matches_python_reference`,
`midgame_position_matches_python_reference`) and the real-movegen
end-to-end test (`position_to_input_matches_hand_built_start_position`).
Those are the only thing currently proving this port is numerically
correct; don't trade correctness for speed without re-validating against
the same Python reference (`tools/reference_forward_aegis_v4.py`, which
loads the same real exported checkpoint at
`artifacts/unarchitectured-v1-final.unarchv1` and computes the identical
forward pass independently in PyTorch — regenerate its printed numbers and
update the Rust tests' expected values if a deliberate precision tradeoff
changes them beyond the current 5e-3 tolerance).

## Where to look

- `unchessed-core/src/aegis_v4_runtime.rs` — the module itself, including
  the benchmark test and all correctness tests.
- `tools/reference_forward_aegis_v4.py` — the independent Python reference
  implementation used to validate correctness. Keep it in sync with any
  intentional behavior change.
- `unchessed-core/src/unarchitectured_v1.rs` — the binary package format
  this reads tensors from (already solid, byte-for-byte verified against
  its Python packer earlier this session — not in scope for this prompt).
- `tools/train_chessformer_v4_a100.py` — the original PyTorch reference
  architecture this was ported from (`AegisV4Chessformer.forward_path`),
  useful if any part of the port's correctness needs re-deriving from
  first principles while restructuring for speed.
